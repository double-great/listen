This test details audible effects of emoji (in alternative text) when read by different screen readers. Inspired by [Emoji Accessibility for Visually Impaired People](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376267). See [the specific test case from the research article on YouTube](https://youtu.be/uIbPcZq6izk?t=480).

## Findings

Emoji descriptions can vary between operating systems and software.

VoiceOver for macOS describes the emoji as angry â€” "looking, huffing in anger face". JAWS describes the emoji as triumphant â€” "looking face with look of triumph". NVDA describes the emoji more objectively â€” "looking face with steam from nose".

This test case shows how spoken description of the emoji may not match visual intention.
