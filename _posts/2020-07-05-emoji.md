This test details audible effects of emoji (in alternative text) when read by different screen readers. Inspired by [Emoji Accessibility for Visually Impaired People](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376267). See [the specific test case from the research article on YouTube](https://youtu.be/uIbPcZq6izk?t=480).

## Findings

Emoji descriptions can vary between operating systems and software.

[VoiceOver on macOS](#face-example-macos) and [VoiceOver on iOS](#face-example-ios) describes the emoji as angry — "looking, huffing with anger face". [JAWS](#face-example-jaws) describes the emoji as triumphant — "looking face with look of triumph". [NVDA](#face-example-nvda) describes the emoji more objectively — "looking face with steam from nose".

This test case shows how spoken description of the emoji may not match visual intention.
